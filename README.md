ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Anirudh Sathish  
Welcome to my GitHub page! I love working on things that are intruiging, challenging.I like taking up challenges,infact I look forward to challenges.I push myself to get outside my comfort zone, redefining my comfort zone in iteration.  
**Journey**  
I have had quiet a journey in computer science.From my days of schooling, I have been very inclined academically and have consistently performed well.In my 12th std, when I was 18 years old, I met with my first challenge. Picking up what I wanted to do,I researched so many careers, read various books and autobiographies. Finally deciding that I wanted to study engineering first. I have always been the kind of person to do everything that was offered, so making this decision was indeed difficult. In this world of amazingly interesting things, how does one pick up just a single field to major in. Today, I am a lot more comfortable with the idea, but it still does not make me happy. The universe has so much to offer to us, yet is it fair for us to niche.(There are philosphical thoughts, that might agree with this, but I will not include them in my musings for now).   
*College Starts*  
_Semester 1_  
So after choosing to do engineering, I signed up to do engineering in electronics and communication, later into my semester 1, I realise that the world of computer science is where all the world shattering things are happening, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of that. I had good grades in my first semester, which allowed me to change my major.So hence, I entered the field of computer science.In my first semester of education, I was exposed to programming in C, which at the time was like breeze to me. Since I had picked it up during my school days.
_Semester 2_ 
In the second semester, I faced discrete maths and data structures. I did do the course well, but I couldn't say that I was satisfied with myself.
It was around this period I found myself caught up in the world of quantum computing.Both my parents are professors, my mum teaches physics and my dad computer science, so I felt it was a very natural thing to move to quantum computing, so in this semester I made sure to attend an online lecture series with my mum on quantum computing which one of her colleagues was offering.By this time I had gone comfortable to the idea of data structures, queue's , stacks's , linkedlist and array had become friends. But I was yet to truly grasp the idea of hashing. In my defence, I was occupied with quantum copmuting. In addition I flourished in differential equations, really liking the field and spreading my wings in the same.  
_Semester 3_  
I studied digital circuit design, in the final year project for this I worked on the idea of quantum gates. In addition, I studied Object oriented programming, design and analysis of algorithms. I understood OOP's quite well and worked on C++. For DAA, I worked on some interesting problems, which did quite reach out to my thinking, I worked on a team with the problems. It made working on the problems easier, but looking back , I think at that stage you ought to try tackle interesting problems on your own. Collaboration is an amazing skill to have, but collaboration works really best, when you are actually amazing at what you are doing. Collaboration works really well when you are working across interdisciplinary teams. It is at this point of the semester, that I find myself in a club, the robotics club and also I have started working on a design project with 2 other team-mates. All of us at this point are looking for problem statements of real life value that we can work on. 
_Semester 4_
