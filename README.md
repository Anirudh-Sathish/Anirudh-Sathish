ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Anirudh Sathish  
Welcome to my GitHub page! I love working on things that are intruiging, challenging.I like taking up challenges,infact I look forward to challenges.I push myself to get outside my comfort zone, redefining my comfort zone in iteration.  
**Journey**
I have had quiet a journey in computer science.From my days of schooling, I have been very inclined academically and have consistently performed well.In my 12th std, when I was 18 years old, I met with my first challenge. Picking up what I wanted to do,I researched so many careers, read various books and autobiographies. Finally deciding that I wanted to study engineering first. I have always been the kind of person to do everything that was offered, so making this decision was indeed difficult. In this world of amazingly interesting things, how does one pick up just a single field to major in. Today, I am a lot more comfortable with the idea, but it still does not make me happy. The universe has so much to offer to us, yet is it fair for us to niche.(There are philosphical thoughts, that might agree with this, but I will not include them in my musings for now).   
*College Starts*  
_Semester 1_  
So after choosing to do engineering, I signed up to do engineering in electronics and communication, later into my semester 1, I realise that the world of computer science is where all the world shattering things are happening, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of that. I had good grades in my first semester, which allowed me to change my major.So hence, I entered the field of computer science.In my first semester of education, I was exposed to programming in C, which at the time was like breeze to me. Since I had picked it up during my school days.
_Semester 2_
In the second semester, I faced discrete maths and data structures. I did do the course well, but I couldn't say that I was satisfied with myself.This remained my story for quite some time, because I was caught up in the world of quantum computing. Both my parents are professors, my mum teaches physics and my dad computer science, so I felt it was a very natural thing to move to quantum computing, so in my third and fourth semesters I used digital circuits and the computer organization course to work on mini projects in the same field.
