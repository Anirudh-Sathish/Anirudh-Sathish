ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Anirudh Sathish  
Welcome to my GitHub page! I love working on things that are intruiging, challenging.I like taking up challenges,infact I look forward to challenges.I push myself to get outside my comfort zone, redefining my comfort zone in iteration.  
**Journey**  
I have had quiet a journey in computer science.From my days of schooling, I have been very inclined academically and have consistently performed well.In my 12th std, when I was 18 years old, I met with my first challenge. Picking up what I wanted to do,I researched so many careers, read various books and autobiographies. Finally deciding that I wanted to study engineering first. I have always been the kind of person to do everything that was offered, so making this decision was indeed difficult. In this world of amazingly interesting things, how does one pick up just a single field to major in. Today, I am a lot more comfortable with the idea, but it still does not make me happy. The universe has so much to offer to us, yet is it fair for us to niche.(There are philosphical thoughts, that might agree with this, but I will not include them in my musings for now).   
*College Starts*  
_Semester 1_  
So after choosing to do engineering, I signed up to do engineering in electronics and communication, later into my semester 1, I realise that the world of computer science is where all the world shattering things are happening, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of that. I had good grades in my first semester, which allowed me to change my major.So hence, I entered the field of computer science.In my first semester of education, I was exposed to programming in C, which at the time was like breeze to me. Since I had picked it up during my school days.
_Semester 2_   
In the second semester, I faced discrete maths and data structures. I did do the course well, but I couldn't say that I was satisfied with myself.
It was around this period I found myself caught up in the world of quantum computing.Both my parents are professors, my mum teaches physics and my dad computer science, so I felt it was a very natural thing to move to quantum computing, so in this semester I made sure to attend an online lecture series with my mum on quantum computing which one of her colleagues was offering.By this time I had gone comfortable to the idea of data structures, queue's , stacks's , linkedlist and array had become friends. But I was yet to truly grasp the idea of hashing. In my defence, I was occupied with quantum copmuting. In addition I flourished in differential equations, really liking the field and spreading my wings in the same.  
_Semester 3_  
I studied digital circuit design, in the final year project for this I worked on the idea of quantum gates. In addition, I studied Object oriented programming, design and analysis of algorithms. I understood OOP's quite well and worked on C++. For DAA, I worked on some interesting problems, which did quite reach out to my thinking, I worked on a team with the problems. It made working on the problems easier, but looking back , I think at that stage you ought to try tackle interesting problems on your own. Collaboration is an amazing skill to have, but collaboration works really best, when you are actually amazing at what you are doing. Collaboration works really well when you are working across interdisciplinary teams. It is at this point of the semester, that I find myself in a club, the robotics club and also I have started working on a design project with 2 other team-mates. All of us at this point are looking for problem statements of real life value that we can work on. 
_Semester 4_
This semester in college I got the opportunity to work on DBMS (Database Management Systems) and Computer Architecture. As a part of the DBMS course, I worked on a website that was to collect travellers to localites of a particular place.It was built on php and javascript. Further for coa, I worked on coming up with solutions for the placement of qubits in superconducting quantum computers. Looking back, I would have loved a little more guidance, maybe a project on the x86 architecture and then build up. I have to be admit I have always been ambitious in my project endeavours.In addition, I got to study the theory of computation, of which currently I remember quite well regular languages, finite automata and turing machines.  
_Summer Ahead_
I worked with my mathematics professor on the idea of carmiachel numbers. Carmiachel numbers are quite fascinating, if one were to study one of fermat's most important works, one would come across fermat's primality testing. It gave a method that ensured that all prime numbers passed it, but there was a pitfall, certain non prime numbers also seemed to make their way through these cracks, and those are what are called as carmiachel numbers. Here we were like people trying to plug in this gap, we were even sucessful in this.This work we submit as a part of a conference. In addition during this time, I went to study factorization and the quantum aspects of the same. I got to work on my first set of quantum computers.
_Sem 5_
Operating systems, Compiler Design and Computer Networks, truly a wonderful taste of courses. To this day I dont feel I have been able to do justice to them, because of the kind of knowledge that seems to exist in this field.Sadly, there seemed to be only a course sanctioned project for computer networks, for which I went on to use ns2 to simulate adhoc routing protocols.  
_Machine Learning Winter_  
I spend my winter break attending a course on machine learning by a prof from the Oakland university,this time was very intense. I spent my mornings listening to classes and my afternoons implementing them. The result of which was being immensely knowledgable in machine learning.  
_Sem 6_
An amazing semester for me, I study biometrics,biostatistics, biosignal processing, pattern recognition and digital image processing. All these subjects seemed to support each other so well and supplemented my knowledge bank well. I had built my own biometric system based on palmprints, developed a system to score the sleep cycle based on raw eeg signals, built my own interactive image enhancer. At this period of my time I work on a research project with Samsung on Acccoustic Scene Classification  
_Summer_  
I intern as a Software Enginner at Quantrium. I polish my python skills, become quite good at it. Learn to write collaboartive code, attending code reviews,regularly documenting my code, writing test cases. At this time I am tasked with improving the eddeicency of a product that deals with extracting usedul information from payslips.My scope was limited to that of the image based pdfs, since the company seemed to have a working solution for text based pdfs. This task involved intense debugging and some crafty coding. I was able to get around 30% increase in accuracy for the same.I wrote some really modular and resuable code for same. I seemed to have achieved this task without too many lines of code.  
_Semester 7_  
My internship continues, in additon I take a course on computer vision, deep learning and accelerated artificial intelligence.I excel in all my courses. I end up topping the deep learning course(NPTEL), I really get to make use of accelerated artifical intelligence on my project in acoustics. I also collaborate and undertake a feasibility study regarding identifying defects in burners. This was quite interesting, since I was involved in coming up with a good image acquisition strategy.
_Winter_  
Attend a winter school at IIT Delhi on program optimization, got to meet some amazing people. In addition, get to see a lot of North India and partake in adventures of a lifetime.  
_Semester 8_  
Work on my final year projects concering minimum spanning binary tree
